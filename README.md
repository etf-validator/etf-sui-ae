# ETF-AdaptersAndExtensions

The etf-sui-owsgtl bundles groovy scripts for testing geo services and for
easily manipulating the SoapUI model and the testing sequence - from within
SoapUI.

The etf-sui-plugin extensions library can compile groovy scripts at runtime,
generate Reports (both are also features in the SoapUI Pro version...), it adds
a schema validation assertion and functions as an adapter for the SoapUI
test driver (ETF-SUITD).The Module can also be used as plugin in SoapUI.

The etf-sui-model-mapper component is used to map the internal soapui model to
the internal etf model.
